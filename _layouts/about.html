     <p> Hi there, my name is Bea!</p>

     <p> I’m a 23 year-old currently working as a Security Engineer, I am graduated in Cybersecurity and Post-graduated in Computer Forensics.
      I’m really passionate about Cyber Threats, and Malware Analysis. </p>
     
     <p> My goal here is to centralize my studies and resources in a way that is easier to find, and eventually develop malwares of my own. </p>

      <p> Feel free to contact me on social media! 👋🏻 </p>
